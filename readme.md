# bibot - Work in progress

Imagine a fabric. A fully automated fabric, no humans in sight. This fabric only produces one kind of product, exactly the same things, over an over again, no variation.
This product are knee big robot model on two chainwheels. Obviously, thats `The Model F â„¢`.

They always come in a pair of two, controlled with a single remote. That's the whole deal. Just two exact same robots with one remote, doing exactly the same thing...

One day, for the very first time, one pair falls through the automated quality assurance test. This pair, whait for it, each of the robot in this pair moves exactly in the opposite direction from the other. You steer right, one moves right, the other left. You steer forward, one goes forward, one backwards.

As any good AI would do, our fabrics AI files this incident under the name `Boby and Billy`. Case number `1-782`. And, as any good AI would have ordered, the robots get dumped in the fabrics huge recycle system.

Now, that's there our journey begins.

# Disclaimer
This game is a side project of a single person, mainly to do something fun at the evenings.
I had this game idea for a while, and just try to give it a go.

It is mainly meant to be played on mobile devices, but will work fine on desktop/laptops as well.

This game will be written in modern JavaScript, with a modern build and dev toolset, like I love to do it.

Sadly, it's very possibly, this will never be finished.

But it is [MIT-](LICENSE)Licensed.
